[🌇](echo/) Hi there👋🏻, I am Lijian Lin, a Computer Vision researcher at [International Digital Economy Academy (IDEA)](https://idea.edu.cn)<img src='./images/idea.jpg' style='width: 2.5em;'>. 
My current research focuses on talking head generation, human video synthesis, talking body generation, human-centric 3D Gaussian Splatting, and video content generation. I welcome opportunities for academic collaboration — please feel free to contact me at linlijian@idea.edu.cn. I got my BS degree from Xiamen University in 2021.
<!-- **My research** include the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, pattern recognition, and statistical modeling/inference with applications for computer vision, computational photography, low-level vision, human-computer interaction, and AR/MR.  -->


I serve as a reviewer for international conferences, *e.g.*, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeuIPS, ICLR, ICML, ACM MM, AAAI, *etc.*.

> 👏 We are currently looking for self-motivated interns to explore cutting-edge techniques such as Gaussian Splatting and DM/FM. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:linlijian@idea.edu.cn) if you are interested. [zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/582929545)
