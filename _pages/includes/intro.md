[](echo/) Hi there👋🏻, I am Yunfei (☁️🪽), a researcher at [International Digital Economy Academy (IDEA)](https://idea.edu.cn)<img src='./images/idea.jpg' style='width: 2.5em;'>. 
I am now working on talking head generation, face tracking, and video content generation research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [liuyunfei@idea.edu.cn](liuyunfei@idea.edu.cn).

I got my Ph.D. degree from Beihang University, advised by Prof. [Feng Lu](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/lufeng/en/index.htm). Previously, I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2017.

**My research interests** include the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, pattern recognition, and statistical modeling/inference with applications for computer vision, computational photography, low-level vision, human-computer interaction, and AR/MR. 

I serve as a reviewer for international conferences and journals, *e.g.*, CVPR, ICCV, NeuIPS, ICLR, ICML, ACM MM, TPAMI, IJCV, PR, TVCG, *etc.*.
